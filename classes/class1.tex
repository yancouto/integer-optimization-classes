An integer program is a problem of the form

\begin{optimize}{IP}
\text{Maximize } c^T x \\
\text{subject to } Ax \leq b \\
x \in \Z^n
\end{optimize}

for some~${A \in \R^{n \x m}, b \in \R^m}$ and~$c \in \R^n$. \\

The LP relaxation of (IP) is the LP obtained from (IP) by dropping the integrality constraint.
Since the feasible region of (IP) is contained in the feasible region of its LP relaxation, the answer for that problem is an upper bound to the IP.
